## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution

<ul><li>Detailed explanation of the proposed solution</li>
<li>The solution is a web application called "Farm2Shop Connect" which creates a digital bridge between small and marginal farmers and urban vegetable shop sellers.</li>

<li>Farmers list available crops and projected harvest timelines; sellers post vegetable requirements and purchase orders, choosing from nearby farmers to ensure freshness and local sourcing.</li>

<li>Orders are fulfilled via accredited delivery partners, streamlining logistics and eliminating intermediaries, thus boosting profit margins for farmers and guaranteeing fresh produce for sellers.</li>

<li>AI modules analyze real-time and historical weather data, soil conditions, and crop health using IoT sensors, satellite imagery, and user inputs.</li>

<li>Personalized crop resource management tips, best planting/harvesting windows, irrigation advice, and pest/disease warnings are delivered in multiple languages, via text and voice, with visuals for low-literate users.</li>

<li>Shop sellers receive ongoing market updates and can offer timely feedback, improving advisory precision and fostering trust-based relationships.</li>

## How It Addresses the Problem

<li>This solution empowers farmers to bypass unreliable third-party agents and directly access city markets, maximizing their income and minimizing unsold surplus.</li>

<li>Real-time, field-specific advice helps farmers reduce guesswork and the risks of overuse of chemicals, optimizing resource usage based on precise weather forecasts and soil health.</li>

<li>Multilingual, voice-enabled AI assistance overcomes language barriers and digital literacy issues, making advanced agri-tech accessible to every farmer.</li>

<li>Continuous feedback and adaptive recommendations ensure that the solution evolves with local challenges and user needs, building long-term resilience.</li>

## Innovation and Uniqueness

<li>A unique, closed-loop supply chain connects producers (farmers) and retailers (shop sellers) in real time, supported by logistics partners, a step ahead of typical agri-marketplaces focused only on listings.</li>

<li>The AI engine proactively manages crop schedules using hyper-local weather predictions and disease alerts, integrating IoT data streams for unparalleled precision.</li>

<li>The dual-side marketplace with direct purchase, predictive crop advisory, and personalized resource management—combined with voice and visual support—remains unmatched in Indian agri-tech.</li>

<li>Continuous impact measurement through scientific yield increases, cost reduction, and environmental tracking is built into the app design.</li>

## Technical Approach

<li>Core stack: React or Angular for front-end web development, Node.js or Django backend, TensorFlow/PyTorch for AI, and cloud hosting on AWS/GCP.</li>
<li>AI modules combine satellite inputs, IoT sensors, weather APIs, and database analytics for crop yield prediction, pest/disease alerts, and advisory recommendations.</li>

<li>Secure payment gateways for transactions and real-time order tracking with integrated logistics APIs.</li>

<li>Multilingual NLP chatbot with voice/text support, trained on regional languages and dialect databases.</li>

<li>Prototype would feature interactive dashboards for both farmer and seller profiles, order processing screens, and advisory panel. Flow diagrams detail user journeys—listing, buying, advisory interaction, delivery, feedback.</li>

<li>Methodology and process for implementation <b>(Flow Charts/Images/ working prototype)</b></li></ul>


## Feasibility and Viability
<li>High feasibility: Agri-marketplaces and delivery platforms have demonstrated technical and commercial viability in India; this combines proven commerce with advanced AI advisory, a unique value proposition.</li>

<li>Challenges: Limited rural connectivity, initial digital literacy among farmers, potential trust issues with new logistics partners.</li>

<li>Overcoming challenges: Offline app mode, local agent partnerships for onboarding, regional language content, transparent payments, and transparent rating/review systems for partners and sellers.</li>

<li>Risk management: Regular audits of delivery quality, phased geographical rollout, continuous feedback loop for app improvement</li>

## Impact and Benefits
<li>Direct income boost for farmers by eliminating middlemen and accessing best prices in city markets.</li>

<li>Scientific resource management—AI-driven advisory reduces fertilizer/pesticide costs and optimizes irrigation, raising yields and lowering expenses.</li>

<li>Social benefits: Enhanced food security, higher rural incomes, reduced urban waste through fresher supply chains, and a model for sustainable agriculture.</li>

<li>Environmental benefits: Lower water/pesticide use with predictive AI, greener logistics, and data-driven crop planning align with climate resilience goals.</li>
